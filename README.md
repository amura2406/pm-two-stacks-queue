# Two Stacks Queue

This repo demonstrates a queue data structure implemented with 2 stacks.
The solution will make each `enqueue` method O(1) in time complexity, 
but will make `dequeue` method up to O(n+1) in time complexity.

The queue will exposed 3 methods:

* enqueue(T item) : void
* dequeue() : T
* isEmpty() : boolean
